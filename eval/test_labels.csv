I went to there with my girl friend; I liked fishes but she did not like because fishes are a little bit oily,0
Good in general. Quality for Kizilay and its surroundings. Lahmacun doesn't taste old,0
My first stop for breakfast in Atakum is a place with quality service and friendly face,0
Place was not clear,1
DEFINITELY DO NOT COME. We came here for breakfast based on the reviews on the way. We said the breakfast called the village breakfast for 2 people. First of all; the employee greeted us disrespectfully; a thousand pieces falling off his face; reluctant movements etc. It didn't taste good either,1
The attitude of the waiters towards the customer was cold,0
The menu content is beautifully varied and satisfying,0
I ate a lot of croissants; but this was the best quality beautiful croissant I've ever eaten in my life. Crispy on the outside; with lots of butter on the inside; the smell was amazing,0
Good place. Meals were good. Service is also good. There is parking in front for cars,0
The menu is incomplete; not much; usually a disaster with happy sweet toys; felt-tip pens and a few cardboard coloring pages,0
Best pizza in the area; very crowded in weekends,0
They have a problem with the service; but if you're going to drink tea; they do it well. Your tea is always hot over the fire,0
I ate the best dove I've ever eaten here. Everyone should come,0
We went for both breakfast and dinner. First of all; it has a very nice environment. When we went for breakfast; we sat inside and one can sit for hours. Its decoration; quiet and nice; being in the trees is very nice. Especially having an open kitchen adds a positive score to the customer,0
Seaside; pleasant place; mediocre food; owners concerned,0
Bread; cheese; sausage all left incredible flavors on our palate. We recommend it to everyone who will go to Ayvalik,0
Very good quality and expensive also always crowded,0
They used to taste better; the chef must have changed,0
Waiters didn't pay attention to me,0
You can't get enough of the thin pizza dough. Overcrowded employees are very concerned. We ate pizza at Mia highly recommend,0
Iskender is very delicious; you can optionally pour butter; what is interesting to me is that there are no treats,0
We paid 150 TL for 2 toast and 2 ayran. The only address of Ayvalik Toast. There are many queues; but the queue moves very quickly. Worth the wait,0
The waiters are scruffy so we didn't feel comfortable eating. The hygiene of the place was also bad,0
The address of quality. The service should be a little faster,0
Unnecessarily expensive; the Arab is addressing the tourist. Good taste,1
It is a place that can be preferred for taste; but the appetizer variety is very weak. The toilets smelled,0
It is not p/p. Doner came cold and that's why it was hard,0
Expensive place,0
In terms of taste; I can't say it's too good because we drink much better ones. As a business performance; even bread is sold for money alongside soup,0
"They have very delicious meat; especially tiny lahmacun, super appetizers; delicious food here. The food is very nice. The workers can be a little more interested. They are very interested in Arab customers. They don't care about us. This situation makes us sad",1
